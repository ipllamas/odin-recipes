     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>A zesty and airy sponge cake, madeleines make for a fantastic, light dessert.</p>
     <p>However, this treat also makes for a great pairing with any hot cup of tea or coffee!</p>

     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>2 Eggs</li>
       <li>3/4 Tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
       <li>1/8 Tsp Salt</li>
       <li>1/3 Cup White Sugar</li>
       <li>1/2 Cup All-Purpose Flour</li>
       <li>1 Tbsp Lemon Zest</li>
       <li>1/4 Cup Butter</li>
       <li>1/3 Cup Granulated Sugar for Decoration</li>
     </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375&#176;F. Butter and flour 3-inch madeleine molds.</li>
      <li>Melt butter and let cool to room temperature.</li>
      <li>In a small mixing bowl, beat eggs, vanilla, and salt at high speed until light.</li>
      <li>Beating constantly, gradually add sugar. Continue beating at high speed until mixture is thick and pale, and ribbons form in bowl when beaters are lifted, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Sift flour into egg mixture 1/3 at a time, gently folding after each addition.</li>
      <li>Add lemon zest and pour melted butter around edge of batter. Quickly but gently fold butter into batter. Spoon batter into molds; it will mound slightly above tops.</li>
      <li>Bake 14 to 17 minutes, or until cakes are golden and the tops spring back when gently pressed with your fingertips.</li>
      <li>Use the tip of the knife to loosen madeleines from pan; invert onto rack. Immediately sprinkle warm cookies with granulated sugar.</li>
    </ol>
